Adds 2 new options when editing a taxonomy term so you can assign a dynamic template to the term archive or for the posts within that term.

== Description ==
This is an add-on plugin for the [Total theme](https://totalwptheme.com/) (will not work with any other theme) which adds two new options inside the Theme Settings metabox while editing any taxonomy term via the WP admin so you can assign a template (WPBakery, Elementor, Gutenberg or other) specific to the term archive or for the posts within that term.
